# Trend Micro AWS Built-In module

This document walks you through the process of deploying the Trend Micro AWS Built-In (ABI) module to the AWS Cloud. It's intended for customers who are using the `cfn-abi-trend-cloudone` ABI and building an ABI project.

The AWS Built-In program validates solutions that are integrated with relevant AWS foundational services such as identity, management, security, and operations. This program helps customers find and deploy a validated solution that addresses specific customer use cases while providing visibility and control of AWS native service integrations.

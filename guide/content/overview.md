### Solution Overview
>>>>>>> after updating

The Trend Micro AWS Built-In module can be used to help you set up three different security outcomes across your organization.

### AWS CloudTrail analysis

The XDR capability of Trend Micro Vision One applies effective expert analytics and global threat intelligence using data collected across multiple vectors, such as emails, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks. It can also analyze the AWS CloudTrail logs from your AWS accounts, identify threats and attacks, alert you to problems, and create a visualization of the log.

<<<<<<< before updating
This ABI module integrates your organizational trail with Trend Vision One, which helps ensure that all CloudTrail events across all accounts in your organization are analyzed by Vision One.

### EC2 instance security agent deployment via SSM

Distributor is an integrated feature of AWS Systems Manager that you can use to store and distribute software packages in your accounts. By integrating Workload Security with AWS Systems Manager Distributor, you can distribute Cloud One Workload Security agents across multiple platforms, control access to managed instances, and automate your deployments.

This ABI module is deployed across either selected or all accounts and Regions. It helps ensure that the Trend Cloud One Workload Security agent deploys to your targeted EC2 instances.

### SecurityHub integration

Security Hub collects security data from AWS accounts, services, and supported third-party partner products. It also helps you analyze security trends to identify high-priority security issues. By integrating Trend Cloud One, you can use aggregated security findings of your containers inside Security Hub.

This ABI module helps ensure that your Trend Cloud events for supported modules are visible in your primary Security Hub account and Region.

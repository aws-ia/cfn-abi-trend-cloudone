##### AWS CloudTrail integration architecture diagram

![AWS CloudTrail integration architecture diagram](/images/cloudtrail-architecture.png)

As shown in the diagram, this integration sets up the following:

* In the log archive account:
  * Amazon CloudWatch events rules to detect new PUTs in the organizational CloudTrail S3 bucket and trigger an AWS Lambda function.
  * The Lambda function forwards the new CloudTrail events to Trend Vision One.

##### SSM integration architecture diagram

![SSM integration architecture diagram](/images/ssm-architecture.jpg)

* In each AWS Organizations account:
  * Four system-manager parameters are created in each AWS Region.
  * For a defined CRON job, the AWS Systems Manager workload security agent association package triggers for '*' instances managed by SSM.
  * The SSM association package deploys workload security agent for unmanaged instances.

##### AWS Security Hub integration architecture diagram

To do.

## Architecture overview

The <project-name> integration establishes a connection between <product-name> and your AWS environment. <product-name> uses IAM roles and policies to access and collect security-related data from your AWS accounts.

The deployment of the <project-name> is automated using AWS CloudFormation. CloudFormation templates are used to provision the required resources, including IAM roles, S3 buckets,[....], and [....].

<product-name> collects [....] from various AWS services, such as <service-1>, <service-2>, and <service-3>. These events are processed and analyzed by <product-name>â€™s to provide additional capabilities like [....].

Based on the information collected, <product-name> provides [....] to improve [....] of your AWS environment. These findings help you perform [....].

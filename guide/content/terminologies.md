* **ABI modules:** GitHub repositories based on AWS SRA, which provide templates for enabling AWS foundational services such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub, and other security services.
* **ABI projects:** The GitHub repositories built by partners in collaboration with AWS. While building these projects, partners use ABI modules to enable AWS services as needed before creating partner-specific assets. A project contains the following:

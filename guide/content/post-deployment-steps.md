## Verifying the solution functionality

Verifying the solution functionality will depend based on what modules/integrations you deployed in the previous step.

### Verifying CloudTrail Analyzes

1. Log in to your [Trend Cloud One](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/home) account.
2. Click in ["Integrations"](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/integrations/) (on the bottom of the page) and select ["Trend Vision One"](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/integrations/vision-one) on the left-hand side of the page.
3. Verify that "AWS CloudTrail" shows up with status of "Connected".
4. Log in to your [Vision One](https://portal.xdr.trendmicro.com/#/dashboard) account.
5. In the Trend Vision One console, go to XDR Threat Investigation > [Search](https://portal.xdr.trendmicro.com/#/app/search).
6. Change the Search Method to Cloud Activity Data.
7. Perform a quick search to locate CloudTrail data. For example, type the following search string and click Search: `*`
8. If you see data, that means the CloudTrail Analyzes deployment was successful.

### Verifying EC2 Instance security agent deployment via SSM

2. Click in ["Endpoint & Workload Security"](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/workload/Application.screen?#dashboard) and select the ["Computers"](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/workload/Application.screen?#computers_root) tab.
3. Verify that the "Agent Status Light Column" shows up with a green indicator light.

5. Under "Integrations" verify that "Trend Micro: Cloud One" shows up the status "Accepting Findings".
6. When the connection is stablish, it generates a test finding, you can verify it by going to "Findings" and filter by "Provider" and use "Cloud One" as a value.
7. If you see the test finding, that means the SecurityHub Integration deployment was successful.
8. Now all the findings generated by Cloud One will be available in SecurityHub.

**Next:** Choose [Test the Deployment](/test-deployment/index.html) to get started.
